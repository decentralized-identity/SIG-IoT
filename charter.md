# DIF Special Interest Group Charter â€“ IoT

This Charter establishes the scope and intellectual property terms used to develop the materials identified in
for the IoT Special Interest Group. Members and contributors will be bound by its terms and be permitted to participate in this Special Interest Group.

### 1. Group Name - IoT Special Interest Group

### 2. Special Interest Group Deliverables.

This Special Interest Group may create: Whitepapers, industry specific schemas and articles relating to the use of decentralized identity based solutions used within the Internet of Things ecosystem.

### 4. Special Interest Group Scope.

The scope of the IoT Special Interest Group is to collaboratively discuss aspects of interest in the IoT community that relate to the use and benefit of decentralized identity to the IoT ecosystem. This includes development of whitepapers, articles and industry specific collateral such as schemas. From time to time, specific industry use cases can be developed and this may instantiate smaller working groups to help develop this material.

### 5. Copyright Licensing.

This special interest group is an open group, which does not have any intellectual property rights association with any collateral or material developed within this group. Work created in this group is covered by the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0

### 6. Patent Licensing.

No Patent License. No patent licenses are granted for material developed by this Special Interest Group.

### 7. Open Community

Decentralized Identity Foundation SIGs are open and global communities where anyone from anywhere can and should be able to participate, contribute, and access tools and information. For example, this means that even with meetings that are held via teleconference, we have to involve those not on the calls who are online. Best practice in an open and global community is to keep in mind time zone differences of the group participants and make sure to include non-meeting participants in group discussions and decisions by active use of the mailing list. All SIGs must adhere to the Decentralized Identity Foundation Code of Conduct.

#### 7.1 Transparency

Meeting details, meeting notes, and documentation shall be made publicly available. The following items shall be generated and made available to the community after each meeting:
Mailing list
Meeting recordings
Github repositories

### 8. Collaborations

The IoT-SIG may collaborate with the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), Decentralized Identity Foundation leadership, and respective project maintainers.

### 9. Membership

#### 9.1. Eligibility for SIG membership

IoT-SIG membership shall be free and open to members of the community who have an interest in issues as they relate to the SIG topic technologies in general. SIG membership is established by subscription to the mailing list.
All participation in the groups activities is voluntary. It is perfectly fine to listen in to a group and do nothing. Of course active contribution is our goal, but it is not a requirement for membership.
Anyone can propose agenda items, activities, and work products. In work products, the only requirement is there's enough buy-in from community members to want to volunteer to complete the product.

#### 9.2 Governance

Governance of the IoT-SIG shall be managed through its membership in accordance with the guidelines and overriding jurisdiction of Decentralized Identity Foundation leadership.
Day-to-day management of the IoT-SIG shall be conducted by elected chair(s). Any actions taken on this basis and having direct effect on IoT-SIG membership shall be reported to membership in a timely manner through established channels of communications.
Voting and Governance is in accordance with the Decentralized identity Foundation Chairs Guide.

### 10. Meetings & Communications

Live meetings can be held weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly as determined by group members via teleconference. In addition, coordination and communication can also happen asynchronously online via the mailing list and chat.

#### 10.1 Agenda

The ranking IoT-SIG chairs will send out an agenda and a call for agenda items in advance (at least 2 days) through both the mailing list and chat channels to ensure that live or online attendees can contribute and know what will be discussed in advance of every meeting.

#### 10.2 Recordings/Minutes

Recordings/minutes for each live meeting should be kept and shared out to IoT-SIG membership after the call.

#### 10.4 Cancelling a Meeting

Meeting cancellations should be made at least 24 hours in advance of any meeting date.
All IoT-SIG membership meetings are placed on the Decentralized Identity Community Calendar. To ensure that a cancelled meeting is removed from the calendar, the person leading the meeting shall send a meeting cancellation request to operations@identity.foundation
Additionally, a meeting cancellation notification shall be made to IoT-SIG membership through both the mailing list and chat channels.

### 11. Disbandment of SIG

Should the scope of the IoT-SIG reach completion, or conversely, the traffic on the various discussion forums, and/or the teleconference activity drop to very low levels, then the ranking IoT-SIG chair may ask the Decentralized Identity Foundation Operations Staff to disband the Special Interest Group.

### 12. SIG Subgroups

Subgroups serve to direct membership efforts toward key areas of mutual or themed interest within the larger IoT-SIG general membership.
Like the parent IoT-SIG, subgroups are obligated to serve as a mechanism for productive and demonstrable work products under the guidance of a lead, who is responsible for transparently communicating subgroup status back to IoT-SIG leadership.

#### 12.1 Creation of Subgroup

Any member of the IoT-SIG may recommend to IoT-SIG leadership the desire to form a subgroup with the intent to serve a specific need or set of needs not already served through the parent IoT-SIG or any existing IoT-SIG subgroup.
Upon approval, that member(s) must identify a subgroup lead, and work with IoT-SIG leadership to develop a subgroup charter.

#### 12.2 Subgroup Charter

An IoT-SIG subgroup charter can follow the same template as the SIG charter.

### 13. Amendments to This Charter

This charter may be altered by a consensus resolution passed at a meeting of IoT-SIG members. All changes made to this charter shall receive final approval from the Decentralized Identity Foundation Operations Staff.
