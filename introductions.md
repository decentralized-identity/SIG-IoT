## Please introduce yourself and share what you hope to get out of participating in the IoT SIG

Hi, I'm Damian Glover. I'm a strategy consultant working mainly in the energy, life sciences, medical device and retail sectors. 

I am honoured to co-chair the new IoT SIG @ DIF with Lubna Dajani. Previously I contributed to the SSI in IoT Working Group @ Sovrin Foundation (chaired by Michael Shea) for 3 years.  

I'm interested in understanding more about how decentralised identity can unlock value for business ecosystems. 

Specifically, I am keen to explore how DIDs and VCs can enable digital twins to interoperate and exchange verifiable information. I hope to identify and work on some real-world use cases with the group. 

I look forward to meeting you and to some great discussions over the coming months.
