## Please introduce yourself and share what you hope to get out of participating in the IoT SIG

Hi, I'm Damian Glover. I'm a strategy consultant working mainly in the energy, life sciences, medical device and retail sectors. 

I am honoured to co-chair the new IoT SIG @ DIF with Lubna Dajani. Previously I contributed to the SSI in IoT Working Group @ Sovrin Foundation (chaired by Michael Shea) for 3 years.  

I'm interested in understanding more about how decentralised identity can unlock value for business ecosystems. 

Specifically, I am keen to explore how DIDs and VCs can enable digital twins to interoperate and exchange verifiable information. I hope to identify and work on some real-world use cases with the group. 

I look forward to meeting you and to some great discussions over the coming months.

Hello Everyone, I am [Dr. Xinxin Fan](https://www.xinxinfan.me/). I am the Founding Member and Head of Cryptography at [IoTeX](https://iotex.io/), a startup empowering the future [machine economy](https://machinefi.com/) with innovative combination of blockchain and IoT. I am responsible for directing the company’s strategy and product roadmap as well as developing the core technologies and IP portfolio. Before joining IoTeX, I was a Senior Research Engineer of the Security and Privacy Group at [Bosch Research Technology Center North America](https://www.bosch.us/our-company/innovation/). I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in 2010. I am also a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) from (ISC)<sup>2</sup> and a (co-)chair of [IEEE P2418.1](https://sagroups.ieee.org/2418-1/) and [IEEE P2958](https://sagroups.ieee.org/2958/) standards working groups.

Previously I have participated in the SSI in IoT Working Group @ Sovrin Foundation for the past few years. I am interested in the decentralized identity and access management for IoT and would like to explore how DIDs and VCs can be used to build a decentralized and trustworthy IoT systems for supporting a wide range of real-world applications. I look forward to discussing with other working group members over the coming months.

Hi. I'm Phil Wolff. More about me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/philwolff/), [Wider Team](https://wider.team/team/philwolff), my occasional product management blog ([Product Hospice](https://producthospice.wordpress.com/)). I help executives and their teams make better strategic choices for a living. I have hung out with and contributed to IIW, IEEE, DIF, ToIP, and Sovrin projects, working groups, task forces, etc. 

I care about what this IoT SIG does because the speed of SSI's spread in the world (which should mostly be a very good thing) is limited by how well it works in the physical world. I want better healthcare, social and economic justice, prospertiy, and a sustainable planet in my lifetime. We won't get there without all the benefits of great identity (and the things that follow).
